                                            This RPi 3 Shiled will allow you to have 16 Channel CT sensors to read its values and then you can host it on website or beam it out to outter Internet. basically, you can do anything you want to do with that data. Basics and reference design is been inspired by OpenEnergyMeter Project, and further, it is been designed in such a way that it can be stackable. But one have to take care of current Ratings. Feel Free to discuss on this and in case you need some customization on this type of shield, do let me know from any freelance platform or directly via mail. Enjoy some of the pics of PCB which i received from <b>pcbway.com.</b> And more to come from pcbway.com.

				                                    This is a quick teaser i would say about my this week work. I hope you find this new and interesting topic to carry out further research on your own as well.
				                                    <br>
				                                    <br>

				                                    Due to the emergence of affordable, portable, sleek wireless communication devices and the advances in the wireless communication techniques, wireless networks attract much attention. However, battery-powered wireless networks/nodes are typically troubled with limited energy supplies. Therefore, energy conservation became on of the core issues in wireless networks.
				                                    <br>
				                                    <br>

				                                    To address these real time problems, we kept our search to come up with some new innovative yet affordable TOPOLOGY and its control which could effectively solve or helps extending the life of the WSN.
				                                    <br>
				                                    <br>

				                                    This week, I was going through various such Topology Control methods and algorithms proposed on various research papers. I found many handsome algorithms and technique proposed by many engineers around the globe. But to work around and implement such algorithms/idea into a real environment will take resources like money and time as well. Instead of that i though to create some GUI application on windows platform Win32 (C++) to visualize MST and Local MST (LMST).
				                                    
				                                    <br>
				                                    <br>
				                                    By creating this application, anybody can take this as reference for doing GDI+ graphics related activities, or as Win32 Dialog based application illustration. I tried to develop the LMST in my way which is not the optimised algo. right now. I have used linked list to handle Vertex of Graph and also to handle Edges.
				                                    <br>
				                                    <br>
				                                    Although i am improving this app and the algorithm for speed optimization, and also inculcating various other topology control algorithms like WDTC, k conected and many more as well. Right now i have kept this on my private repo as it is quite unstable in terms of performing operations like delete nodes or edit nodes. So stay tuned as i update the same with the git public repo. I am having fun doing this.

                                        Another week, some more and new creations. Pocket modem, a sweet and simple, yet handy, board so designed for one who want to use it as normal router Wifi enabled with b/g/n networking capabilities, 1x WLAN and 1 x Lan Port, and itâ€™s also for developers who want to dive into Router Software development using OpenWRT or similar router OS platforms. A sleek hassle free development board for OpenWRT. This is the teaser of the board right now and looking forward to get the boards done in small quantity. If you want some of the boards to be ready, do let contact me.

		                                    I will be adding up soon once i get few boards done( assembled ). The board is designed carefully by keeping high Speed signals and USB lines in mind, hence controlled impedance lines runs on this double layer board. Ethernet PCB guidelines and USB 2.0 standard PCB design guide lines are been followed to make this working. It will come with Integrated Magnetics Rj45 connectors from Hanrun which is an alternative for cost cutting, yet, better space utilization on board is achieved, by not placing separate magnetics on the board.

                                     		Along with that there is an arrangement for ADC interfacing with Raspberrypi on 3.3v TTL levels. Basically, you can connect your Current Sensors to this terminals, 4 of them and can get current of voltage at any given instance.

For now very few screens and behaviors are been developed, i wish anybody out there want to contribute on this are welcome. i will keep this posted as this progress along. IDE i am using is Nokia IDE which based on eclipse UI benchwork. Looking forward to puch this application to store once this is completed.

											If you are looking out to get started up with windows GUI based application development in C programming language. This is one of those post which is best for you to go through and jump start with your application. In current scenarios, web technologies and web app are the mainstream focused solutions, but still, existing systems which are windowed application types, are mainstream investment sector. Metro UIed Apps came and almost replaced all those windowed application but for commercial or been a commercial product to be, app stick to be a windowed application. Anyways, lets not catch up this as debate, but lets get started with win32 application development in no time.

		                                BluetoothÂ® Smart is the intelligent, power-friendly version of Bluetooth wireless technology. While the power-efficiency of Bluetooth Smart makes it perfect for devices needing to run off a tiny battery for long periods, the magic of Bluetooth Smart is its ability to work with an application on the smartphone or tablet you already own. Bluetooth Smart is an application-friendly technology supported by every major operating system. The technology costs less and offers flexible development architecture for creating applications to bring everyday objects like heart-rate monitors, toothbrushes, and shoes into the connected world and have them communicate with applications that reside on the Bluetooth Smart compatible smartphones, tablets, or similar devices those consumers already own.

		                                			This is the basic minimal requirement to get started with BLE development. This will cost you not more than $110 and many components are included with this like segger j-link and 5 nrf51822 ICs and supporting connectors. there is another board for it named as &#8220;motherboard&#8221;. The &#8220;motherboard&#8221; is not mandatory to start development with nrf BLEs. With this buy, you ill get one KEY or say PRODUCT KEY against which you can download required and necessary softwares like nrf SDK and nrfStudio which will help you in the course of development.
